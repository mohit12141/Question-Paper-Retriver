# Question-Paper-Retriver-
This script helps you to find the files in a directory of various files.


 ## What I did?
 There was a lot of folders and various folders inside a folder. This folders were of question papers and they contained .pdf files.
 I created a python script that will find the papers in the directory by a specific word.
 
 It will search for a substring in the name of files and copy them to the specified destinantion files.
 
 ### NOTE : The code is dependent on my systems directory.
